                I have learned as an <span class="electronics">electronics technician</span> in school for four years.
                After that i went to the same profession for two years to the same school.
                I was in love with the tech and the underlying solutions. Ever since i remember iam
                curious about what brings the material to life, about what gives so much power to the hands of a human.

              <h5>Electrician</h5>

              After all that, for my own safety i went to do an Electrician degree. I already knew a huge part of these
              bigger systems since i was
              worked at a Company as an Electronics Techinican so the degree just came in handy. I worked a little bit
              in that field as a Maintenance
              of the company's production Lines. It was messy, but i loved every part of it.

                Since i was obsessed with the <span class="electronics">electronics</span> and wanted to know more about
                it, when i did, i needed to controll it.
                I wanted to get my hands on the power it can give. So i started to tinker and learn about different
                Chips and Microcontrollers.
                When i put together my first <a
                  href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/astable.html">astabil multivibrator</a>
                with some 555 IC i was felt the need to go deeper. Played with <span class="chipBrand">Atmel</span>
                chips, <span class="chipBrand">PICs</span>
                and finally i was introduced to my current MCU, wich is an <span class="chipBrand">ESP32</span> from a
                company called <span class="chipBrand">Espressif</span>.

                Web is in a special place in my hearth. I did not know anything about it and i don't really wanted to
                develop web things. But with the discovery of one
                of my favourite MCU, the <span class="chipBrand">ESP32</span> brought the knowledge of the web in the
                form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT</a>.
                It taught me different languages such as <span class="progLang">PHP</span> and <span
                  class="progLang">Javascript</span>. I started to learn
                <span class="writeLang">HTML</span> and <span class="writeLang">CSS</span>. By the time I remembered i
                was making a Smart Home project with an

                <span class="backend">Backend</span> and a fairly complex <span class="frontend">Front-End</span> with

                Networking was the choise of the flow. I had to learn and understand the principles if i wanted to make
                IoT projects.
                I learned so much along the way from IPV4 to how data packets are processed on different ends.
                I had to make serious changes on routers, gateways and eventually i made my own router at home with an
                <span class="chipBrand">ESP32</span>
                and the help of the <span class="progLang">IDF</span> framework. When i was an electrician at my second
                company i did a little bit of networking job.
                I managed my boss's both public and private network inside the company. If one of the lines had a
                network issue
                <span class="text-muted">(e.g PLC did not communicate with a HMI )</span> i was the one who solved it.
                I managed the restrictions on the networks, white and blacklists, etc..etc..

                  Boxy was a gift for my girlfriend back then. It was an interactive box with a story writed by hand. 
                  The main purpose of this box was at that time we don't really meet up with each other for various reasons and i wanted to give her a gift
                  even if i was not there. So the box was opened up at every month for 15 min and handed her a small gift. It has a WiFi hotspot, a touch screen built in
                  where it showed various faces. If it's orientation changed, or if it was on opened state etc.. it showed some face according to the event.
                  On first power on, the screen showed the story of the creature in a box, how it is trapped there and she had to touch on various answers and the story
                  changed with every decision. After the story on the first bootup the box opened it's wifi hotspot, and if somebody connected to it, it showed its own mind
                  in the form of a "web app". Inside it's mind she could read the whole story again and some other easter eggs, she could see the counter for the opening event
                  and had some more easter eggs like drawing on the screen etc.. On the web, she could read a little poem from the gift that was inside it. And every time it opened, the
                  poem was changed according to the gift.

                  The remote car project is just a showcase where me and my friend wanted to prove to ourself that we can build a badass remote car.
                  It has three esp32 inside. An esp32 CAM where we can see whats going on with a phone, a controller esp32 wich controlls the pwm and the remote controller's
                  signal and an other esp32 inside the remote controller. Yes i know it's too much but i wanted to try the espressif's own protocol, the ESP NOW between the
                  car and the controller. The car has four 18650 battery, a motor controller with an active cooler on it an esp32, a servo motor for the steering wheel and
                  a 12v DC motor for the drive. The car has some issues. It's built with full aliexpress things from china so we had things like the motor controller was caught
                  on fire once and things like that.

                  The Moodlamp Project is a bigger project's smaller part. When i built my own remote file system ( or drive copy ) for myself and for my friends
                  i implemented a little event system inside it. I couldn't do https at that time, so when someone among my frineds created an event none knew about it
                  just when they opened up the drive. So i figured that i could create a moodlamp for each one of them and this lamp could communite with the server,
                  and if there were new event created, the lamp would light up for them. Hovewer that part is not implemented yet, but it's a cool little moodlamp wich can
                  light up in multiple different animations wich the user can pick and on it's hotspot the user can pick static colors, can save them and things like that.
